A separate user account with such App Stores may be necessary for the purpose of downloading the Apps. The goal of Sandbox Interactive is to deliver the same gaming experience on all devices including mobile devices. However, due to technical or platform limitations game performance, graphics quality, sound quality and response times achieved by playing on mobile data connections and/or mobile devices and/or connected devices may not be completely equivalent to those when playing via stationary data connections and/or stationary devices. On some devices and operating systems, certain functions and contents may not be available at all.\n4.2.2 Only natural persons may register for the Game and set up a User Account (\"User Account\"). Once Users have registered and set up a User Account they may play the Game in compliance with the Game Rules. Participation in the Services is for entertainment purposes only, any use of the Services for commercial purposes is prohibited unless specifically allowed in these Terms or the Game Rules. Promoting the Game on YouTube, Twitch and other video and streaming sites is permitted, but, in our sole discretion, we can withdraw that permission at any time by notifying the User in writing.\n4.2.3 Only persons of legal age or persons whose legal guardians have provided consent to the use are allowed participation. At the time of registration for our Services, the User represents that he is of legal age and of legal capacity or that his legal guardians have provided consent. If the User is a minor, then the legal guardian must provide consent. We are entitled to request at any time written proof of the User's legal age or the written consent of the legal guardian. As soon as a minor uses his User Account after he becomes of legal age, then all agreements in connection with him/her concluded before achieving legal age are deemed approved provided he does not revoke the approval toward Sandbox Interactive within two weeks upon reaching legal age.\n4.3 Genre\nThe Game is what is known as a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) taking place in a medieval-style fantasy game world.\n4.4 In-Game-Features, Virtual Benefits and Premium Features\nThe User may acquire Virtual Benefits from a Game-Shop in exchange for real money to use in connection with the Game. Sandbox Interactive may restrict the award or use of Virtual Benefits based on your country of residence or other factors. Sandbox Interactive may offer the opportunity to purchase Virtual Benefits from a Game-Shop for real money and to utilize Virtual Benefits directly in exchange for paying a fee. The User will be expressly notified if the service offered is not free and the User will be informed about his right of withdrawal (if any). Sandbox Interactive informs the User of the respective features, requirements and prices of the Virtual Benefits prior to the purchase. The Virtual Benefits are available after the Users have made their payment, in some cases, depending on availability, using virtual currency or real money. Note: Some Virtual Benefits may also be received through gameplay or as part of a game pack.\n4.4.1 Premium Status (Subscription)\n4.4.1.1 Users may acquire Premium Status for real money for one of their Game Characters for a specific period of time (\"Premium Time\"). If Premium Time is purchased together in a pack with other Virtual Benefits like Gold or Vanity Items, that pack is referred to as a Premium Bundle or Starter Bundle. The associated fee is paid for the entire period up-front. This acquisition of Premium Time for real money concludes a subscription agreement (\"Subscription\") with Sandbox Interactive for the respective Game Character. For Subscriptions entered into before March 1st 2022, the Subscription will automatically be renewed for the same amount of Premium Time originally bought and with the same means of payment, when the remaining Premium Time on the Game Character is 3 days or less. If a User with an active Subscription for a Character acquires additional Premium Time for that Character, the time at which the Subscription renews is pushed back by the amount of additional Premium Time acquired. Subscriptions that are entered into after March 1st 2022 shall be renewed for an indefinite period of time and may be terminated with one month's notice. The price per month after automatic renewal depends on the initial term: it is calculated by dividing 30 days by the original term of the Premium Status subscription and multiplying the result by the price for the initial term of the Premium Status subscription. In the case of Premium Time subscriptions made as part of a Premium Bundle or Starter Bundle, the Virtual Benefits included in the bundle in addition to the Premium Time are granted only once at the time of Subscription. Renewal of the Subscription does not grant any additional Virtual Benefits beyond the Premium Time.\n4.4.1.2 The User can stop the automatic renewal of a Subscription by cancelling it giving 5 business days' notice to Sandbox Interactive in text form (email will suffice) or by using the account management section provided by Sandbox Interactive for cancelling a Subscription. We may still accept a shorter notice period, but have no obligation to do so. The Subscription can be canceled without giving reasons. Please note that there will be no partial or full refund for already acquired Premium Status, neither in the form of real money nor in any other form, unless explicitly specified in these Terms and Conditions.\n4.4.2 Gold\n4.4.2.1 The User has the opportunity to acquire Gold, the Premium Currency, for real money. Gold can be used in-game to acquire Premium Status and other Virtual Benefits, such as so called vanity Items, and other content or services that we may offer from time to time. Gold can also be traded in-game with other Users and via the in-game currency exchange, though we explicitly reserve the right to restrict, modify or remove the User's ability to do so.\n4.5 General Ruleset for Virtual Benefits\n4.5.1 Users are prohibited from selling, purchasing, renting, leasing, offering, accepting, disseminating or copying Virtual Benefits, including Virtual Currency, within and/or outside the Game - in whatever form - to/from third parties unless expressly permitted by these Terms and Conditions or the Game Rules. An in game-system provided by the Game or by Sandbox Interactive to trade Virtual Benefits of the Game constitutes such an exception. In this case, the transfer of Virtual Benefits from one User to the other is only permitted if the transfer takes place - no matter if within or outside the Game - either without any form of consideration or with consideration if the consideration consists solely of Virtual Property or Virtual Currency of the Game and as such is transferred within the Game itself or via a function provided by the Game. The acquisition of Virtual Benefits in exchange for any form of consideration other than Virtual Property or Virtual Currency of the Game is expressly prohibited. If the User trades or exchanges Virtual Benefits on a large scale without a comparable value obtained within the Game, then it is assumed that the User violates this rule. The User is entitled to provide counter-evidence. For the avoidance of doubt, Users are also prohibited from knowingly supporting, aiding or abetting other Users in breaching this clause 4.5.1.\n4.5.2 By making a selection from the Virtual Benefits credited to their User Account to be used in the Game, Users specify performance regarding characteristics of the Game and modify the gaming experience within the Game Rules and the scope granted to them by the \"purchase\" during the Term or the duration of the Virtual Benefits. The scope and duration of Virtual Benefits are subject to run-times and expire at the end of the period identified in the Shop or during the purchase. The permission to use Virtual Benefits ends at the latest at the time when the agreement to use the Game concluded between User and Sandbox Interactive expires or is terminated.\n4.5.3 Virtual Benefits that can be bought for real money can often also be obtained in-game through other means, for example by purchasing them with Virtual Currency or by trading with other players. When a Virtual Benefit is initially bought for real money for an Account, it counts as having been bought for real money for that Account only. As a general rule, Virtual Benefits bought for real money by an Account do not count as having been bought for real money by any other Account, for example, if the other Account obtains that benefit via an in-game trade. If an Account buys a certain Virtual Benefit for real money, but also has obtained or obtains more of the same Virtual Benefit via in-game means, then every time the Account transfers, uses, consumes, trades, loses or spends a portion of that Virtual Benefit, it is assumed that those parts of the Virtual Benefit acquired with real money by that Account are used first. Under no circumstances shall we be required or liable to refund or compensate a User in relation to any Virtual Benefits that have not been bought for real money as defined above.\n4.5.4 The User understands, accepts and agrees that he holds no interest, monetary or otherwise, in any feature or content contained in the Game, including without limitation the Accounts registered to him or any Virtual Benefits.\n4.5.5 As a rule, Users may only use Virtual Benefits purchased for real money after they have expressed their consent and have acknowledged, prior to the purchase, that they lose their right of withdrawal.\n4.5.6 There is no return policy on Virtual Benefits. Virtual Benefits acquired through virtual currency or real money cannot be exchanged back to virtual currency or real money subject to any constellation regulated in these Terms and Conditions.\n4.5.7 Sandbox Interactive may decide to change features of the Game at its own reasonable discretion, unless this is legally deemed to be unacceptable for the Users, and to cease offering its services, subject to the provisions regarding the termination of this Agreement. The Virtual Benefits and Services offered by us in exchange for virtual currency or real money may be discontinued, modified or removed from the User's Account by us at any time in our sole and absolute discretion. We have no obligation to continue making offers available for the redemption of Virtual Benefits. Sandbox Interactive is entitled to reduce and/or increase the prices for Virtual Benefits with regard to the future and to create and sell new Virtual Benefits at any time.\n4.5.8 Sandbox Interactive may, in their sole and absolute discretion, make regular changes to the Game's balance. This includes, but is not limited to, the power of particular items, the design of the game world, features of the game and the entire virtual economy. This may result in a significant perceived reduction of the in-game strength of a User's Virtual Benefits. We will not be required to provide any in-game or out of game compensation for this.",

Sandbox Interactive will notify the User by email or within the Game of any price changes with regard to his Subscription. These changes are deemed accepted by the User, if the User has not objected to the price changes in part or in whole in writing (email will suffice) within six weeks upon receipt of the information on the price change.

Users may access the Game Shop to choose, subject to a charge and depending on the respective offer, the type and number of Virtual Benefits they wish to purchase.\n9.1.2 To continue Users have to confirm their selection, choose a payment method and finalize the purchase, by confirming the button labeled with \"Buy now\" plus, if applicable, the respective payment method (e.g. \"Buy now with PayPal\").

Users are permitted (non-exclusively) to use the Virtual Benefits, while the Game is available and during the term of the Agreement, to modify the gaming experience according to the Game Rules. Virtual Benefits can only be used in the Game and only while the User Account is active.\n9.2.2 As a rule, Users may only use Virtual Benefits after they have expressed their consent and have acknowledged that they lose their right of withdrawal or the right of withdrawal has expired otherwise (e.g. by time).\n9.2.3 No additional Contract using Virtual Benefits\n9.2.4 The use of Virtual Benefits is an act of playing the game and the Users exercise their right to specify characteristics of the Game and modify the gaming experience within the Game Rules and provided features.

Each User is advised to assess the identity of another User where necessary. Sandbox Interactive is entitled but not obliged to verify the accuracy of the User's information. This may be done by Sandbox Interactive requesting documents to prove the identity such as a personal ID card. Sandbox Interactive is entitled to make the creation of a User Account subject to such verification.\n11.6 The Users are reminded to treat all access data and all data provided by us for the purpose of accessing the Game and Services (login, passwords which should be changed regularly etc.) in a strictly confidential manner and not to disclose them to any third party or allow any third party to use their User Account unless Sandbox Interactive has approved the transfer of the account in writing.\n11.7 If a third party uses a User Account after gaining possession of the access data because the User did not sufficiently secure these from third party access, then the User is responsible for any damages or similar caused by the User's failure.\n11.8 The User will inform us via email without delay if he learns or suspects that an unauthorized third party has gained possession of said access data. In case of a justifiable suspicion that access data are known to unauthorized third parties and were used by third parties, then for security reasons Sandbox Interactive has the right but it is not obliged to change the access data at its own discretion and without prior notification. Alternatively, Sandbox Interactive has the right to block the User Account. In the above cases, Sandbox Interactive shall use reasonable efforts to inform the authorized User immediately and upon request about the suspected unauthorized access and it shall provide the new access data within a reasonable time. For security reasons, Sandbox Interactive may require proof of identity before doing so. However, in case the User's email account connected to the Services is compromised, Sandbox Interactive will usually have no means of contacting and communicating with the User. In such cases, the User has no claim for his original access data to be restored.\n11.9 The User agrees that he will under no circumstances login into the User Account of any other User.\n11.10 The User is not entitled to transfer or sell his User Account to a third party or let a third party use their User Account without the prior written consent of Sandbox Interactive.

Users may insist on the removal - wholly or in part - of Content provided by them in the event that the Content constitutes either a breach of the Users' obligations, in particular with regard to their conduct, or if there is a legal obligation to delete, or the Content affects general rights of personality (Persönlichkeitsrechte).\n15.5.2 In case of extraordinary termination by Sandbox Interactive, we reserve the right to terminate any other accounts you may have created or will create in the future. To enforce this provision, in particular if the User was involved in botting, cheating, advertising for his own or third party services or financial fraud, Sandbox Interactive may retain data necessary to prevent that User from creating additional Accounts to carry out similar violations. Sandbox Interactive may prevent the User from creating additional User Accounts and immediately suspend additional User Accounts created by such User without prior warning.\n15.5.3 If Sandbox Interactive is responsible for the extraordinary termination by the User, then it will only provide compensation for the portions unused Premium Currency and the portions unused Premium Time that count as \"bought by the User's Accounts for real money\" as specified in 4.5.3. In this case, Sandbox Interactive will reimburse the User the pro-rated value of Premium Currency and Premium Time still credited to his Accounts and associated Characters. Further claims of the User are excluded unless otherwise specified in these Terms and Conditions.\n15.6 Sanctions\nNotwithstanding any statutory or other contractual rights Sandbox Interactive can temporarily or permanently restrict or disable access to the Game or the Services for any Users who are at fault for being in continued, repeated or severe breach of statutes, third party rights, Game Rules or these Terms and Conditions. Sandbox Interactive may temporarily or permanently bar Users according to legal regulations. For example, Sandbox Interactive may restrict the chat functionality or suspend a User from the forum if this User offends other Users in the forum or chat. As another example Users may be banned permanently if they use cheats or bots. The sanctions for the misconduct cited are only examples. Sanctions can vary based on the infraction in question.\n\n§ 16 Liability\n16.1 Sandbox Interactive is liable according to the statutory provisions under the applicable law for damages of Users caused by intentional or grossly negligent conduct by Sandbox Interactive or its vicarious agents (Erfüllungsgehilfen) and for personal injury and damages according to the German Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz).\n16.2 In all other cases, Sandbox Interactive's liability for damages - irrespective of the legal grounds - shall be limited as stipulated in the provisions below unless a guarantee accepted by Sandbox Interactive says otherwise:\n16.2.1 Sandbox Interactive shall only be liable for damages caused by slight negligence to the extent that such damages result from violating essential contractual obligations (cardinal duties, Kardinalpflichten), i.e. such obligations whose fulfillment is a prerequisite for properly fulfilling the Agreement and which Users may normally expect. Accordingly, insofar as Sandbox Interactive is liable for slight negligence, Sandbox Interactive liability shall be limited to the typically foreseeable damage.\n16.2.2 Sandbox Interactive's liability for damages caused by loss of data and/or programs due to slight negligence is limited to the typical cost of restoration, which would have been incurred in case of regular and appropriate data backup by the Users.\n16.3 The provisions of the above paragraph 16.2 apply accordingly to a limitation of the obligation to indemnify for futile expenses (section 284 German Civil Code).\n16.4 The above limitations of liability apply in favor of Sandbox Interactive's vicarious agents (Erfüllungsgehilfen) as well.\n16.5 Sandbox Interactive is not liable for costs incurred by the Users for services which are expressly not offered by Sandbox Interactive, in particular costs for data transfer to or from the Users' mobile devices.\n16.6 The parties agree that insofar as the providing of the Services can be considered a lease contract under German civil law, Sandbox Interactive shall not be liable according to section 536a subsection 1 of the German Civil Code, and this statutory provision shall not be applicable (meaning: no warranty without culpability for defects present from the outset).\n16.7\nB. IF YOU ACCESS THE GAME OUTSIDE OF EUROPE\nNB.: THIS CLAUSE DOES NOT APPLY IF YOU ACCESS THE GAME IN EUROPE\nI. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL SANDBOX INTERACTIVE OR ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE GAME OR DEFECT IN OR CAUSED BY THE GAME, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO COMPROMISING THE SECURITY OF YOUR COMPUTER, OPERATING SYSTEM OR FILES, OR THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, EVEN IF SANDBOX INTERACTIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY CASE, SANDBOX INTERACTIVE'S ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE GAME OR REPLACEMENT OF THE GAME WITH PRODUCT OF COMPARABLE RETAIL VALUE, AS SANDBOX INTERACTIVE MAY ELECT IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. BECAUSE SOME STATES AND JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU IN PART OR WHOLE.\nNB.: THIS CLAUSE DOES NOT APPLY IF YOU ACCESS THE GAME IN EUROPE\nII. Users agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sandbox Interactive and its affiliates and their respective officers, employees, directors, agents, Users (excluding you), sub-Users (excluding you), successors and assigns from and against any and all liability, costs, losses, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) arising out of any claim, suit, or cause of action relating to and/or arising from (a) User's breach of any term of this Agreement; (b) User's violation of any rights of any third party; or (c) User's use or misuse of the Website or the Game including the Apps. User's indemnification obligations set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n\n§ 17 Availability\n17.1 Unless otherwise agreed, no specific availability of the Services, the Game and the Website is agreed. Sandbox Interactive nevertheless strives to provide access to the Services, the Game and the Website for all Users 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Temporary operational interruptions due to standard maintenance and inherent disruptions of the internet due to third party providers or third party network operators as well as instances of force majeure are possible. Accordingly, no continuous access to the Service is warranted to the User.\n17.2 On a monthly average, Sandbox Interactive will provide an availability of 90% for the Game, beginning with the official release of the Game, and specifically excluding any tests or test servers. Exempt from this are periods during which the Game cannot be reached due to problems beyond the influence of Sandbox Interactive (e.g. force majeure, culpability of third parties, etc.). The periods during which regular maintenance takes place (usually 1 hour per day) are also exempt therefrom. Also exempt are queue times that might occur if the Game's traffic is higher than expected, in particular in the first weeks after game update releases. Sandbox Interactive shall not be liable for the unavailability if it is within the above parameters. Sandbox Interactive' liability for non-availability of the server shall remain unaffected in the case of intent and gross negligence.\n17.3 With regard to mobile devices and the internet error free performance is not warranted. In particular, Sandbox Interactive is not liable for the continuous availability of its technical system, nor for the completeness, accuracy or up to date nature of the information made available to the User by himself or other Users or third parties for errors in the transmission of data.\n17.4 The Game and Website may not be accessible worldwide. Whether the Game and Website can be accessed fully or in a limited manner may depend on legal regulations and licensing requirements in particular countries. The description of the Game may include more details about this situation.\n\n§ 18 Consumer Information\nMandatory Consumer information regarding the Game may be found here: https://albiononline.com/en/consumer-information.\n\n§ 19 Data Protection, Privacy Policy\nThe Privacy Policy may be viewed at https://albiononline.com/en/privacy_policy.\n\n§ 20 Applicable Law\nThis Agreement and all disputes arising from it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with German law with the exception of the CISG, even if the User has his domicile abroad. In relation to Users who are consumers, this choice of law shall only apply insofar as the User is not deprived of such protection which is provided by mandatory statutory provisions, i.e. which cannot be waived by private agreement, of the country in which the User has his habitual residence.\n\n§ 21 Game Rules\nAdditional Game Rules can be viewed at https://albiononline.com/en/game-rules.\n\nEffective February 13, 2023",

    "@LOGIN_POPUP_PRIVACY_POLICY": "Privacy Policy\nA. Privacy declaration for Sandbox Interactive GmbH\n(albiononline.com)\n\nThe information in this declaration applies to the processing of personal data on or via our website and is intended in particular to inform you of the scope of processing, the purposes of processing, the recipients, legal bases, storage periods and your rights. Personal data are all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, i.e. a person (hereinafter also referred to as \"data subject\"), including for example your name, your address or your email address. Processing\" of personal data means in particular the collection, storage, use and transmission of such data.\n \nI. Name and Address of the data controller\nThe data controller within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other national data protection laws of the member states as well as other data protection regulations is:\n\nSandbox Interactive GmbH\nPappelallee 78\n10437 Berlin\nGermany\nEmail: info@sandbox-interactive.com\nWebsite: albiononline.com\n \nII.

General information data processing\n1. Legal basis for the processing of personal data\n\nInsofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for the processing of personal data, legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.\n\nInsofar as the processing of personal data is required for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.\n\nInsofar as the processing of personal data is required to fulfil a legal obligation to which our company is subject, legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR.\n\nIf processing of data is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the first-mentioned interest, legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.\n\n2. Data deletion principle and storage time\n\nThe personal data of the data subject will be deleted or processing restricted as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply. Hard copy printouts of personal data are shredded or burned, whereas electronic files of personal data are disposed through technical or physical means that ensure the information cannot be recovered. In certain cases, data can be stored if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other provisions to which the data controller is subject.\n\n3. Data Recipients\n\nEmployees of our company and service providers who support us in data processing within the scope of a commissioned data processing agreement (e.g. service providers for IT operations) have access to your personal data to the extent necessary to fulfil the purposes stated below. We are legally obliged in individual cases to transmit personal data to authorities (e.g. requests for information from investigating authorities) or natural/legal persons (e.g. to assert claims). Further information on possible recipients of your personal data can be found in the next sections of this privacy policy.\n\n4. Transfers to third countries\n\nIf we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if such processing takes place in the context of using the services of third parties or disclosure or transfer of data to third parties,  this will only take place in order to fulfil our (pre-)contractual obligations, on the basis of your consent, on the basis of a legal obligation or on the basis of our legitimate interests. Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we will only process or transfer the data to a third country outside of the EU if the special requirements of Art. 44 ff. GDPR are met. This means that the processing is carried out, for example, on the basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognized determination of a level of data protection corresponding to that of the EU (e.g. for Canada, Japan, Switzerland) or compliance with officially recognized special contractual obligations (so-called \"EU standard contractual clauses\"). \n\nIV.

Storage time\n\nThe data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. In the case of the collection of data for the provision of the website, this is the case when the respective session has ended.\n\nIf the data is stored in log files, this will happen after seven days at the latest. Further storage is possible. In this case, however, the IP addresses of the users are deleted or made anonymous, so that an identification of the accessing client is no longer possible.\n\n5. Recipient of the data and transfer to a third country\n\nWe use the services of the processor G Core Labs S.A., 2A, Rue Albert Borschette, L-1246 Luxembourg (G-Core) to process personal data.

This can also be done automatically. If cookies are deactivated for our website, it may no longer be possible to use all functions of the website. Otherwise, the necessary cookies are automatically deleted after 14 days.\n\nVI. Remember Me function\n1. Description and scope of data processing\n\nUsers of our services can choose the so-called \"Remember Me\" function.

Purpose of data processing\n\nThe purpose of using the \"Remember Me\" cookie is to increase the convenience of using our website. The \"Remember Me\" cookie is not used to create user profiles.\n\n4. Duration of storage\n\nThe \"Remember Me\" cookie is stored in the user's browser until the user revokes his or her consent. This can be done by logout of the account or by deleting the cookie ['keeploggedin'] in the browser settings.\n\nVII. Newsletter\n1. Description and extent of data processing\n\nIf you register on our website for Albion Online and grant us the right to use your email address for a newsletter, we may subsequently use this for sending you a newsletter in which we inform you at regular intervals about news in connection with Albion Online (e.g. about patches, updates, community events, special promotions, interesting information about the development of Albion Online and, if applicable, offers about our game) The data from the input mask is transferred to us during registration:\n\nEmail address\nIn addition, the following data is collected upon registration:\n\nIP address of the accessing device\nThe date and time of registration\n\n2.

Purpose of data processing\n\nIn this regard, the collection of the user's email address serves to deliver the newsletter witch contains information about patches, updates, community events, special promotions, interesting information about the development of Albion Online and, if applicable, offers about our game. The collection of other personal data as part of the registration process serves to prevent misuse of the services or the email address used. This also constitutes our legitimate interest in the processing.\n\n4. Storage time\n\nThe data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of its collection is no longer given. The user's email address will therefore be stored until the user withdraws his consent to receiving the newsletter. If we need the user's email address for further purposes (see further details in this data privacy declaration), the deletion will be replaced by the corresponding restriction on processing, i.e. we will no longer use the email address for sending the newsletter.\n\nThe other personal data collected during the registration process will generally be deleted after a period of seven days.\n\n5. Possibility of opposition and elimination\n\nThe affected user can withdraw his consent to the dispatch of the newsletter at any time. For this purpose there is a corresponding link in every newsletter. Furthermore, the user can unsubscribe from the newsletter in his account settings. For the withdrawal of consent no other costs arise than the transmission costs according to the basic rates.\n\n6.

The companies thus offer sufficient guarantees for adequate data protection within the meaning of Art. 46 GDPR.\n\nAWS EMEA SARL is a subsidiary of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Inc, 410 Terry Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109 so a transfer of your personal data within the company to the US is possible.\n\nA transfer to AWS within the meaning of the GDPR is permissible according to Art. 44, 46 GDPR, as they have concluded EU standard contract clauses with us. The company thus offers sufficient guarantees for adequate data protection within the meaning of Art. 46 GDPR.\n\nAWS is permitted to process personal data outside the European Union. This is legitimate as AWS has concluded EU Standard Contractual Clauses with their service providers (subcontractors). A copy of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses can be found here: https://d1.awsstatic.com/legal/aws-gdpr/AWS_GDPR_DPA.pdf\n \nVIII. User requests by contact form, email and Facebook\n1.

Purpose of data processing\n\nPurpose of data processing is the handling of requests, in particular support requests for technical problems with the game and the handling of other questions. The processing of personal data serves us solely to handle the contact approach. Unless we process the data for the purpose of fulfilling contractual or pre-contractual obligations, this is also our legitimate interest in the processing of the data which outweighs the user's interest .\n\n4. Storage time\n\nThe data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of its collection is no longer given. For the personal data from the input mask of the contact form and those that were sent by email, this is the case when the respective conversation with the user is finished. The conversation is finished when the circumstances indicate that the matter in question has been solved.\n\nIf data is collected in the course of email communication which we are obliged to store due to tax, commercial law or other regulations, it will not be deleted until the respective legal retention or storage periods have expired.

The personal data provided are used to identify the user by creating a user account. The creation of the user account enables the user to participate in the online game Albion Online and to create, manage and use his own characters in the context of the game.\n\n4. Storage time\n\nThe data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of its collection is no longer given. For the data collected during the registration process, this is usually the case when the user contract is terminated and the user's account is deleted.\n\nIf data is collected in the course of the registration which we are obliged to store due to tax, commercial law or other regulations, it will not be deleted until the respective legal retention or storage periods have expired.

If deletion is not possible, processing may be restricted.\n\n6. Recipient of the data and transfer to a third country\n\nWe use the services of the processor G Core Labs S.A., 2A, Rue Albert Borschette, L-1246 Luxembourg (G-Core) to process personal data. G-Core is permitted to process personal data outside the European Union. This is legitimate as G-Core has concluded EU Standard Contractual Clauses with their service providers (subcontractors). G-Core thus offers sufficient guarantees for an adequate data protection according to Art. 46 DSGVO. A copy of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses can be found here: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:039:0005:0018:DE:PDF\n\nWe confirm the registration of an account and each completed purchase process with a transactional email.

This is legitimate as AWS has concluded EU Standard Contractual Clauses with their service providers (subcontractors). A copy of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses can be found here:\nhttps://d1.awsstatic.com/legal/aws-gdpr/AWS_GDPR_DPA.pdf\n\nA transfer to AWS in the USA as a third country within the meaning of the GDPR is permissible according to Art. 44, 46 GDPR, as they have concluded EU standard contract clauses with us. The company thus offers sufficient guarantees for adequate data protection within the meaning of Art. 46 GDPR. \n \nX. Gaming operation\n1. Description and extent of data processing\n\nAs part of the provision of the game Albion Online, we store and process the datasets necessary for the operation of the game and website. For this purpose, we also store data in logs when using the game. Logs are protocols of certain technical contents.\n\nIn-game-storage and processing includes the following data:\n\nTime of the log-ins\nIP address\nInformation about actions in the game\nProgress of the game\nNews\nUser messages/chat protocols\nInformation on operating systems and hardware used\n2. Legal basis for data processing\n\nThe legal basis for the processing of the data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR and, insofar as the personal data are processed for the execution of a contract, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.\n\n3. Purpose of data processing\n\nThe purpose of data processing is the technical implementation and the provision and operation of the game. The specific purpose of saving the logs is a technical improvement of the game Albion Online (quality assurance). To prevent program crashes and other malfunctions (in the future) it is necessary to record and analyze them. In case of a crash of Albion Online or a problem in the game process, an error analysis can be performed by reading the logs in connection with your IP and ID and information about the device used. The chat logs are stored in order to be able to trace the respective chats in case of complaints, e.g. because of insults.\n\nThese purposes also constitute our legitimate interest in the processing of personal data, which outweighs the user's interest in not processing, unless we process the data for the purpose of fulfilling contractual or pre-contractual obligations.\n\n4. Storage time\n\nThe data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of its collection is no longer given. This is the case as soon as the data is no longer required for the use and provision of the game, for example if you have deleted your account and there are no further reasons for storing the data. The log data is kept as long as it is required for the purpose of analysis and diagnosis of the cause of crashes or malfunctions or fraud detection. As a rule, the data is deleted immediately after the facts have been clarified, but at the latest after 3 years. The chat logs/ -protocols are usually deleted after 30 days.\n\nIf certain data is collected in the course of gaming operations which we are obliged to store due to tax, commercial law or other regulations, it will not be deleted until the respective legal retention or storage periods have expired. The legal basis for this data storage is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR.\n\n5. Recipients of the data and transfer to a third country\n\nAs part of our gaming operations, we share your information with various companies in Canada and the USA.\n\nWe forward the log data to OVH Canada, 50 Rue de l'Aluminerie, Beauharnois, QC J6N 0C2, Canada, that stores the logs for quality assurance as a processor (cf. Art. 28 GDPR). Your personal data will be processed by these companies in Canada on our behalf for quality assurance purposes.\n\nA transfer to OVH to Canada as a third country within the meaning of the GDPR is permissible according to Art. 44, 45 GDPR, as an adequate level of data protection is given for Canada in relation to this company.\n\nOn the basis of Art. 25 para. 6 EU-data privacy directive (1995), the EU Commission has issued an adequacy decision (2002/2/EC) for Canada, i.e. there is an intergovernmental agreement between Canada and the European Union. This agreement regulates the protection of personal data transferred to Canada from a member state of the European Union. Accordingly, private companies subject to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) are required to provide adequate data protection. This ensures an adequate level of protection for the processor OVH despite the lack of an adequacy decision by the EU Commission within the meaning of Art. 45 GDPR.\n\nWe will forward your data to Backblaze Inc, 500 Ben Franklin Ct San Mateo, CA 94401, USA, which takes over backup services for the log data as a processor (cf. Art. 28 GDPR) within the scope of quality assurance. Your personal data will be processed by this company in the USA on our behalf for quality assurance purposes. Backblaze Inc. has concluded EU standard contractual clauses with us and thus offers sufficient guarantees for adequate data protection within the meaning of Art. 46 GDPR.\n\nWe will also forward your data to Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, which handles quality assurance as a contract processor using the Crashlytics tool (cf. Art. 28 GDPR). Your personal data will be processed by this company in the USA on our behalf for quality assurance purposes. Google has concluded EU standard contractual clauses with its group companies in the USA and thus offers sufficient guarantees for adequate data protection within the meaning of Art. 46 GDPR.\n\nWe use the services of the processor G Core Labs S.A., 2A, Rue Albert Borschette, L-1246 Luxembourg (G-Core) to process personal data. G-Core is permitted to process personal data outside the European Union. This is legitimate as G-Core has concluded EU Standard Contractual Clauses with their service providers (subcontractors). G-Core thus offers sufficient guarantees for an adequate data protection according to article 46 GDPR. A copy of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses can be found here: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:039:0005:0018:DE:PDF\n \nXI. Payment and verification of payment\n1.

This is the case as soon as the check for the corresponding payment transaction has been completed and it has been ensured that the corresponding payment was made legally.\n\nIf data is collected in the course of payment operations which we are obliged to store due to tax, commercial law or other regulations, it will not be deleted until the respective legal retention or storage periods have expired. The legal basis for this data storage is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR.\n\n5. Recipients of the data (and transfer to a third country)\n\nAs part of the payment, we will forward the data specified under point X. No. 1. to the service provider Adyen BV, Simon Carmiggeltstraat 6-50, 1011 DJ Amsterdam, Netherlands. Adyen then collects the data relevant for the payment as contract processor (cf. Art. 28 GDPR) for us and processes the payment. Adyen only stores your payment data in Europe.\n\nAs part of the payment via PayPal, Adyen will forward the information described in section X.

    "@LOGIN_POPUP_PRIVACY_POLICY_TITLE": "Privacy Policy",
    "@LOGIN_POPUP_REFERRAL_TERMS_AND_CONDITIONS": "1.    Scope of these Terms\n\n1.1.    Sandbox Interactive GmbH, Pappelallee 78/79, 10437 Berlin, Germany (\"Sandbox Interactive\") operates an online game and a gaming portal called Albion Online (\"Albion Online\"). Sandbox Interactive offers the users of Albion Online (\"Users\") rewards for encouraging other natural persons to play Albion Online, subject to these Terms and its general Terms and Conditions.\n\n1.2.    Sandbox Interactive may change these Terms with regard to future use. Unless the Terms are changed by explicit consent (e.g. User confirms new terms in a pop up window) Sandbox Interactive will change these Terms according to the following procedure: Sandbox Interactive will notify the Users of such changes in text form (i.e. email or a notification in the Account of the User), particularly highlighting any differences in regard to the version previously in force. Users may object to such changes to these Terms according to the following provisions: Users need to direct their objection against the changes to the Terms (\"Modifications\") to Sandbox Interactive within six (6) weeks after receipt of Sandbox Interactive's notification concerning the Modifications (\"Modification Notice\"). The objection must be received by Sandbox Interactive within the time limit. If the User does not object in due time, the Modifications will be deemed accepted and the modified Terms will become an integral part of the agreement with the User. The Modification Notice will expressly refer to this effect and to the form and time limit of the objection. In the event of an objection in due form and time, the Terms will remain in force in their unaltered version. In this case, Sandbox Interactive may terminate the agreement in accordance with 8.3.1.\n\n2.    Definitions\n\nAccount: An Account is a combination of email address and password that a natural person can create on AlbionOnline.com via the registration page or via a purchase from the shop.\nGame: Game means the game Albion Online.\nPremium Status Activation: Premium Status Activation for an Account is the act of getting at least 30 days of Premium Time credited to any single Game Character on that Account. Only Premium Time that has been bought from Sandbox Interactive for real money, or has been bought from the in-game shop of the Game, counts towards the Premium Status Activation. Premium time that has been given out as a reward for playing the game or has been given out for free by Sandbox Interactive - for example, as part of a promotion or compensation - does not count. The First Premium Status Activation is the first time that any Character on an Account fulfills the above criteria. Each Account can only have one (1) First Premium Status Activation, even if multiple Characters on that Account activate Premium. \nReferred Account / Referral: A Referred Account or Referral is an Account i) that was successfully tracked via a Referral Link of another Account\nReferrer: A Referrer is the Account for which a Referral counts as referred by, as specified in Section 4 below. \nReferral Link: A Referral Link is a special link or associated referral code made available on AlbionOnline.com to each Account and is specific to that Account. A User can share the Referral Link of his Account with other persons in order to generate Referrals under these Terms.\nReferral Program: The Referral Program is a program in connection with Albion Online which enables Users to earn rewards, subject to these Terms, for encouraging natural persons to play Albion Online.\nReward: Rewards are benefits awarded to the Referrer for having generated Vested Qualified Referrals in accordance with these Terms.\nUser: A User is a natural person who has created an Account.\nWebsite: The Website means AlbionOnline.com\n\nAll definitions contained in Albion Online's Terms and Conditions also apply to these Referral Program Terms and Conditions, whereas the Referral Program Terms and Conditions will take precedence in case of conflicting definitions. \n\n3.    Specifications\n\nUnder the conditions specified in these Terms Sandbox Interactive offer Rewards to Users who encourage other persons to play Albion Online according to these Terms. Users can take part by using the Referral Link provided by Sandbox Interactive for their Account and sending it to another person. Rewards are only awarded to Users for the generation of Vested Qualified Referrals (4.1.) for which the User is the Referrer. No Rewards are given for Disqualified (4.4) Referrals. Any qualified Referrals generated according to 4.1. below (\"Qualified Referrals\") may become Disqualified Referrals retroactively subject to these Terms.\n\n4.    Referral Program\n\n4.1.    Making Referrals. Users may take part in the Referral Program by distributing the Referral Link provided by Sandbox Interactive. Users may be eligible for a Reward under the conditions of these Terms by generating Vested Qualified Referrals subject to the following rules:\n\n4.1.1.   Somebody creates an Account through a User's Referral Link and the Account is successfully identified as that User's Referral.\n\n4.1.2. No Character on the Referred Account has previously carried out a Premium Status Activation as defined in section 2.\n\n4.1.3 The Referred Account now makes its First Premium Status Activation as defined in section 2. It then counts as a Qualified Referral for its Referrer and becomes a Vested Qualified Referral after a specified time period as published by Sandbox Interactive on the Website (\"Vested Qualification Period\") since the first Premium Status Activation has passed, provided that the Referral is not Disqualified during that time.\n\n4.2.    Referral Link. An Account may be set up via a Referral Link as follows:\n\n4.2.1.    A person receives a Referral Link, clicks on the link, is then transferred to the website AlbionOnline.com and sets up an Account with the Game by clicking \"register\" and entering their email address.\n\n4.2.2.    A person receives a Referral Link, clicks on the link, is then transferred to the website AlbionOnline.com and provides their email address as part of making a purchase on the website. An Account is then set up at that email address.\n\n4.2.3.        Sandbox Interactive may allow Users to manually enter a Referral Link or associated referral code upon or shortly after Account creation. If this option is offered by Sandbox Interactive and used by the User, it will override any Referral Link that the User has previously clicked on for the sake of tracking Referrals. The User whose Referral Link or associated code was manually entered upon Account creation will count as sole the Referrer.  \n\n4.3.   - \n\n4.4.    Disqualified Referral. Sandbox Interactive may, in their sole discretion, disqualify a Referral if at least one of the following is true:\n\n4.4.1.    the Referral was generated in violation of these Terms, in particular, without limitation, the Marketing Rules, or applicable statutory provisions, and/or\n\n4.4.2.    the Referral is in breach of the general Terms and Conditions, and/or\n\n4.4.3.    the payment for the Premium Time Activation fails to clear, and/or\n\n4.4.4.    the Referral is subject to a chargeback.\n\nA Referral that is disqualified is called a \"Disqualified Referral\" or \"Disqualified\".\n\n4.5    Tracking. If a person creates an Account after being redirected to AlbionOnline.com via a Referral Link, the system will attempt to identify - for example by the use of cookies - that the Account was created via the User's Referral Link and subsequently, subject to 4.2, record the Account created as the User's Referral for the time being. Sandbox Interactive does not guarantee that their process of tracking referrals functions in all instances or without error. Accounts that have not been identified by our tracking process as being set up as a result of a referral by a User will generally not count as Referred Account, unless this failure was caused by Sandbox Interactive's intentional or grossly negligent conduct.\n\n5.    Rewards\n\n5.1.    Rewards are given to Users for the generation of Vested Qualified Referrals for which the User is the Referrer, and which are not Disqualified.\n\n5.2.    The Rewards offered are published on AlbionOnline.com and are subject to be changed with regard to the future by Sandbox Interactive at any time without prior notice to Users. If Sandbox Interactive changes the Rewards, they will generally aim to publish a cut-off date in advance at which the old Rewards will be phased out and replaced by the new Rewards. However, there is no obligation to do so. \n\n5.3.    The Reward granted to Users for generating a Vested Qualified Referral depends on the Rewards that were applicable at the time at which that Referral first became a Qualified Referral. Please note that in the event that Sandbox Interactive publishes incorrect information regarding Rewards by mistake, for example by accidentally publishing an incorrect reward amount on the website by inadvertently having added an extra zero to the gold amount promised, Sandbox Interactive reserves the right to declare avoidance (Anfechtung) vis a vis the Users whose Referrals became Qualified Referrals while the incorrect information regarding the Reward was applicable.\n\n5.4.    No Rewards are given for Disqualified Referrals Referrals. \n\n5.5.    Rewards given for Vested Qualified Referrals that become Disqualified retroactively subject to these Terms will be clawed back by Sandbox Interactive.\n\n5.6.        In the case that multiple rewards can be earned for a single Qualified Referral, each reward is subject to its own Vested Qualification Period.  \n\n6.    Marketing Rules\n\n6.1.    Users are allowed to promote and market Albion Online by using their Referral Link subject to these Terms and to the general Terms and Conditions, and in particular to the rules and restrictions outlined in this section 6.\n\n6.2.    No email spam. Users may not send unsolicited emails to promote Albion Online.\n\n6.3.    No social media spam. Users shall not repeatedly flood the same social media channel or community with identical or similar messages promoting Albion Online\n\n6.4.    No cookie dumping. Users shall not use technical means to place their referral cookie on people's devices without them knowingly and willingly visiting the Albion Online website.\n\n6.5.    No false representation. Users shall not frame or duplicate the Albion Online website, give the impression that their website or social media channel is officially related to Sandbox Interactive or that Users are somehow affiliated with the game or its developers.  \n\n6.6.    No unsuitable content. In promoting Albion Online, Users shall not use communication or content that is obscene, indecent, discriminatory, hostile, offensive, pornographic or illegal.\n\n6.7.    No copyright infringement. In promoting Albion Online, Users shall not infringe on the intellectual copyright of others.\n\n6.8.    No kick backs. Users shall not offer any rewards - whether in-game or out of game - in return for somebody being referred by them.\n\n6.9.    No reselling. Users shall not sell game packs or Premium Time or trade them in return for a consideration, monetary or otherwise. Users may give away game packs or Premium Time as a gift. \n\n6.10.    No solicitation of User data. Users shall not solicit sensitive data from others Users or prospective Users. In particular, this applies to login credentials and payment data.\n\n6.11.    No self referral. Users shall not create an Account via a referral link belonging to one of their own Accounts.\n\n7.    Intellectual Property and other Rights\n\n7.1.    Sandbox Interactive permits Users to use trademarks and intellectual property rights during the Term to the extent necessary and solely for the purpose of promoting Albion Online via Referrals as set forth in these Terms.\n\n7.2.    Sandbox Interactive reserves all rights.\n\n7.3.    Unless otherwise expressly agreed, there shall be no transfer of rights or goodwill under these Terms.\n\n8.    Term and Termination\n\n8.1.    Term: This agreement is concluded for an indefinite period of time and ends with its termination. This agreement shall end automatically when the agreement about the use of the game as such ends. \n\n8.2.    Termination by Users. Users may terminate this agreement at any time by closing their Account by contacting support@albiononline.com or otherwise by sending a termination notice in text form. Sandbox Interactive advises Users that they remain bound by these Terms as long as the Account is not closed or this agreement is otherwise terminated.\n\n8.3.    Termination by Sandbox Interactive.\n\n8.3.1.    Sandbox Interactive may terminate your participation in the Referral Program at any time without cause, giving seven (7) days' notice in text form. \n\n8.3.2.    The right to terminate for a compelling reason without notice or with a shorter notice period (as the case may be) shall remain unaffected. For example, Sandbox Interactive may terminate the Agreement for a compelling reason if the User is acting fraudulently or in breach of the Marketing Rules.\n\n8.4.    Effects of termination.\n\nIf a User's participation in the Referral Program is terminated in accordance with\n\n8.4.1.    clause 8.2. or 8.3.1., the User will no longer be able to generate new Referrals, and existing Referrals will no longer be able to become Qualified Referrals. Referrals that are already Qualified Referrals at the time the termination becomes effective will still be able to become Vested Qualified Referrals.\n\n8.4.2.    clause 8.3.2 the User will no longer be able to generate new Referrals and all of the User's existing Referrals will be disqualified. Sandbox Interactive shall also have the right, in their sole discretion, to recover previously given Rewards from a User's Account if such Rewards were obtained by the User being in breach of a duty under these Terms or the general Terms and Conditions and/or such Rewards that were disqualified retroactively and the claw back according to 5.5 has failed.\n\n9.    Liability\n\nA.\n\n9.1.    Sandbox Interactive is liable without restriction according to the statutory provisions under the applicable law for damages of Users caused by intentional or grossly negligent conduct and for personal injury and damages according to the German Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz).\n\n9.2.    In all other cases, Sandbox Interactive's liability for damages - irrespective of the legal grounds - shall be limited as stipulated in the provisions below unless a guarantee accepted by Sandbox Interactive says otherwise:\n\n9.2.1.    Sandbox Interactive shall only be liable for damages caused by slight negligence to the extent that such damages result from violating essential contractual obligations (cardinal duties, Kardinalpflichten), i.e. such obligations whose fulfillment is a prerequisite for properly fulfilling the Agreement and which Users may normally expect. Accordingly, insofar as Sandbox Interactive is liable for slight negligence, Sandbox Interactive's liability shall be limited to the typically foreseeable damage.\n\n9.2.2.    Sandbox Interactive's liability for damages caused by loss of data and/or programs due to slight negligence is limited to the typical cost of restoration, which would have been incurred in case of regular and appropriate data backup by the Users.\n\n9.3.    The provisions of the above 9.2 apply accordingly to a limitation of the obligation to indemnify for futile expenses (Art. 284 German Civil Code, BGB).\n\n9.4.    The above limitations of liability apply in favor of Sandbox Interactive's vicarious agents as well.\n\n9.5.    Insofar as the providing of Sandbox Interactive's services can be considered a lease contract under German civil law, Sandbox Interactive shall not be liable according to section 536a subsection 1 of the German Civil Code (BGB), and this statutory provision shall not be applicable (meaning: no warranty without culpability for defects present from the outset).\n\nB. IF YOU ACCESS THE GAME OUTSIDE OF EUROPE\nNB.: THIS CLAUSE DOES NOT APPLY IF YOU ACCESS THE GAME IN EUROPE\n\nI. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL SANDBOX INTERACTIVE OR ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE GAME OR DEFECT IN OR CAUSED BY THE GAME, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO COMPROMISING THE SECURITY OF YOUR COMPUTER, OPERATING SYSTEM OR FILES, OR THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, EVEN IF SANDBOX INTERACTIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  IN ANY CASE, SANDBOX INTERACTIVE'S ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE GAME OR REPLACEMENT OF THE GAME WITH PRODUCT OF COMPARABLE RETAIL VALUE, AS SANDBOX INTERACTIVE MAY ELECT IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION.  BECAUSE SOME STATES AND JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU IN PART OR WHOLE.\nNB.: THIS CLAUSE DOES NOT APPLY IF YOU ACCESS THE GAME IN EUROPE\n\nII. USERS AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS SANDBOX INTERACTIVE AND ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, USERS (EXCLUDING YOU), SUBUSERS (EXCLUDING YOU), SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LIABILITY, COSTS, LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES) ARISING OUT OF ANY CLAIM, SUIT, OR CAUSE OF ACTION RELATING TO AND/OR ARISING FROM (A) USER'S BREACH OF ANY TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT; (B) USER'S VIOLATION OF ANY RIGHTS OF ANY THIRD PARTY; OR (C) USER'S USE OR MISUSE OF THE WEBSITE OR THE GAME INCLUDING THE APPS.  USER'S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SENTENCE SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n10.    Mandatory Information for Consumers      \n\nOnline dispute resolution. The European Commission developed a platform for online dispute resolution (OS), you can find it under http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr. European Consumers can use this site for dispute resolution to reach an out-of-court settlement.\nSandbox Interactive does not take part in the above online dispute resolution program, but is required by law to inform consumers about it.\n\n11.    General\n\n11.1.    Notices. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms,\n\n11.1.1.    Notices by Sandbox Interactive to Users may be sent by email, via the in-game client or game launcher.\n\n11.1.2.    Notices from Users to Sandbox Interactive may be sent by email to support@albiononline.com or by ticket to customer service on AlbionOnline.com.\n\n11.1.3.    Announcements to all Users may be made via the website.\n\n11.2.    Governing Law. This agreement and the entire contractual relationship between Sandbox Interactive and the User are subject to the laws of Germany, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), even if the User has his personal or company domicile abroad. In relation to consumers, this choice of law shall only apply insofar as the consumer is not deprived of such protection which is provided by mandatory statutory provisions, i.e. which cannot be waived by private agreement, of the country in which the consumer has his habitual residence. The User is deemed a consumer if the transaction in question (e.g. ordering the goods in the shopping cart) is made by the User as a natural person for purposes that predominantly are outside his trade, business or profession.\n\nEffective April 10, 2019",

However, if the User terminates this agreement, this is treated as a notice for cancellation for all Subscriptions subject to their respective provisions.\n15.4 Termination by Sandbox Interactive.\n15.4.1 Subject to the special stipulations for Subscription, Sandbox Interactive may terminate this Agreement at any time without cause, giving fourteen (14) days' notice in text form.\n15.4.2 The statutory right to terminate this Agreement for a compelling reason with a shorter notice or even without notice shall remain unaffected.\n15.4.3 A compelling reason is given if one party, taking into account all the circumstances of the specific case and weighing the interests of both parties, cannot reasonably be expected to continue the contractual relationship for the agreed term or until the expiry of a notice period.\n15.4.4 Compelling reasons include for example (without limitation):\n*        If the User is engaged in cheating, use of bots, financial fraud or severe abuse of bugs. The User is hereby advised that Sandbox Interactive will, without prior warning, immediately suspend all access of the User to the Game in these circumstances to protect the integrity and reputation of the Game.\n*        If the User is culpably in violation of applicable law or of these Terms and Conditions, the Game Rules and/or use rules for Virtual Benefits;\n*        If the User is in arrears with the payment of fees due;\n*        If the User issues a payment dispute or charge-back;\n*        If third parties (e.g. social network operators), through whose registration function the User gains access to his Account at Sandbox Interactive, requests Sandbox Interactive to delete the user data and/or to undertake any comparable actions or limits Sandbox Interactive' access to data.\n15.4.5 Sandbox Interactive reserves the right to terminate the operation of the Game in the future. In such an event, Sandbox Interactive will announce the cessation of the game three months in advance and any transition services it may offer in the future for such case.\n15.5 Effects of termination.\n15.5.1 Once the termination becomes effective, the Users' Accounts will be deleted, including any Virtual Benefits still present on these User Accounts and associated Characters. Content posted by the User on the Website will either be removed, or the User's name associated with the Content will be removed instead. Users may insist on the removal - wholly or in part - of Content provided by them in the event that the Content constitutes either a breach of the Users' obligations, in particular with regard to their conduct, or if there is a legal obligation to delete, or the Content affects general rights of personality (Persönlichkeitsrechte).\n15.5.2 In case of extraordinary termination by Sandbox Interactive, we reserve the right to terminate any other accounts you may have created or will create in the future. To enforce this provision, in particular if the User was involved in botting, cheating, advertising for his own or third party services or financial fraud, Sandbox Interactive may retain data necessary to prevent that User from creating additional Accounts to carry out similar violations. Sandbox Interactive may prevent the User from creating additional User Accounts and immediately suspend additional User Accounts created by such User without prior warning.\n15.5.3 If Sandbox Interactive is responsible for the extraordinary termination by the User, then it will only provide compensation for the portions unused Premium Currency and the portions unused Premium Time that count as \"bought by the User's Accounts for real money\" as specified in 4.5.3. In this case, Sandbox Interactive will reimburse the User the pro-rated value of Premium Currency and Premium Time still credited to his Accounts and associated Characters. Further claims of the User are excluded unless otherwise specified in these Terms and Conditions.\n15.6 Sanctions\nNotwithstanding any statutory or other contractual rights Sandbox Interactive can temporarily or permanently restrict or disable access to the Game or the Services for any Users who are at fault for being in continued, repeated or severe breach of statutes, third party rights, Game Rules or these Terms and Conditions. Sandbox Interactive may temporarily or permanently bar Users according to legal regulations. For example, Sandbox Interactive may restrict the chat functionality or suspend a User from the forum if this User offends other Users in the forum or chat. As another example Users may be banned permanently if they use cheats or bots. The sanctions for the misconduct cited are only examples. Sanctions can vary based on the infraction in question.\n\n§ 16 Liability\n16.1 Sandbox Interactive is liable according to the statutory provisions under the applicable law for damages of Users caused by intentional or grossly negligent conduct by Sandbox Interactive or its vicarious agents (Erfüllungsgehilfen) and for personal injury and damages according to the German Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz).\n16.2 In all other cases, Sandbox Interactive's liability for damages - irrespective of the legal grounds - shall be limited as stipulated in the provisions below unless a guarantee accepted by Sandbox Interactive says otherwise:\n16.2.1 Sandbox Interactive shall only be liable for damages caused by slight negligence to the extent that such damages result from violating essential contractual obligations (cardinal duties, Kardinalpflichten), i.e. such obligations whose fulfillment is a prerequisite for properly fulfilling the Agreement and which Users may normally expect. Accordingly, insofar as Sandbox Interactive is liable for slight negligence, Sandbox Interactive liability shall be limited to the typically foreseeable damage.\n16.2.2 Sandbox Interactive's liability for damages caused by loss of data and/or programs due to slight negligence is limited to the typical cost of restoration, which would have been incurred in case of regular and appropriate data backup by the Users.\n16.3 The provisions of the above paragraph 16.2 apply accordingly to a limitation of the obligation to indemnify for futile expenses (section 284 German Civil Code).\n16.4 The above limitations of liability apply in favor of Sandbox Interactive's vicarious agents (Erfüllungsgehilfen) as well.\n16.5 Sandbox Interactive is not liable for costs incurred by the Users for services which are expressly not offered by Sandbox Interactive, in particular costs for data transfer to or from the Users' mobile devices.\n16.6 The parties agree that insofar as the providing of the Services can be considered a lease contract under German civil law, Sandbox Interactive shall not be liable according to section 536a subsection 1 of the German Civil Code, and this statutory provision shall not be applicable (meaning: no warranty without culpability for defects present from the outset).\n16.7\nB. IF YOU ACCESS THE GAME OUTSIDE OF EUROPE\nNB.: THIS CLAUSE DOES NOT APPLY IF YOU ACCESS THE GAME IN EUROPE\nI. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL SANDBOX INTERACTIVE OR ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE GAME OR DEFECT IN OR CAUSED BY THE GAME, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO COMPROMISING THE SECURITY OF YOUR COMPUTER, OPERATING SYSTEM OR FILES, OR THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, EVEN IF SANDBOX INTERACTIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY CASE, SANDBOX INTERACTIVE'S ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE GAME OR REPLACEMENT OF THE GAME WITH PRODUCT OF COMPARABLE RETAIL VALUE, AS SANDBOX INTERACTIVE MAY ELECT IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. BECAUSE SOME STATES AND JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU IN PART OR WHOLE.\nNB.: THIS CLAUSE DOES NOT APPLY IF YOU ACCESS THE GAME IN EUROPE\nII. Users agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sandbox Interactive and its affiliates and their respective officers, employees, directors, agents, Users (excluding you), sub-Users (excluding you), successors and assigns from and against any and all liability, costs, losses, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) arising out of any claim, suit, or cause of action relating to and/or arising from (a) User's breach of any term of this Agreement; (b) User's violation of any rights of any third party; or (c) User's use or misuse of the Website or the Game including the Apps. User's indemnification obligations set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n\n§ 17 Availability\n17.1 Unless otherwise agreed, no specific availability of the Services, the Game and the Website is agreed. Sandbox Interactive nevertheless strives to provide access to the Services, the Game and the Website for all Users 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Temporary operational interruptions due to standard maintenance and inherent disruptions of the internet due to third party providers or third party network operators as well as instances of force majeure are possible. Accordingly, no continuous access to the Service is warranted to the User.\n17.2 On a monthly average, Sandbox Interactive will provide an availability of 90% for the Game, beginning with the official release of the Game, and specifically excluding any tests or test servers. Exempt from this are periods during which the Game cannot be reached due to problems beyond the influence of Sandbox Interactive (e.g. force majeure, culpability of third parties, etc.). The periods during which regular maintenance takes place (usually 1 hour per day) are also exempt therefrom. Also exempt are queue times that might occur if the Game's traffic is higher than expected, in particular in the first weeks after game update releases. Sandbox Interactive shall not be liable for the unavailability if it is within the above parameters. Sandbox Interactive' liability for non-availability of the server shall remain unaffected in the case of intent and gross negligence.\n17.3 With regard to mobile devices and the internet error free performance is not warranted. In particular, Sandbox Interactive is not liable for the continuous availability of its technical system, nor for the completeness, accuracy or up to date nature of the information made available to the User by himself or other Users or third parties for errors in the transmission of data.\n17.4 The Game and Website may not be accessible worldwide. Whether the Game and Website can be accessed fully or in a limited manner may depend on legal regulations and licensing requirements in particular countries. The description of the Game may include more details about this situation.\n\n§ 18 Consumer Information\nMandatory Consumer information regarding the Game may be found here: https://albiononline.com/en/consumer-information.\n\n§ 19 Data Protection, Privacy Policy\nThe Privacy Policy may be viewed at https://albiononline.com/en/privacy_policy.\n\n§ 20 Applicable Law\nThis Agreement and all disputes arising from it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with German law with the exception of the CISG, even if the User has his domicile abroad. In relation to Users who are consumers, this choice of law shall only apply insofar as the User is not deprived of such protection which is provided by mandatory statutory provisions, i.e. which cannot be waived by private agreement, of the country in which the User has his habitual residence.\n\n§ 21 Game Rules\nAdditional Game Rules can be viewed at https://albiononline.com/en/game-rules.\n\nEffective February 13, 2023",
